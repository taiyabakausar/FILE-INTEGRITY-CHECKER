The File Integrity Checker is a Python tool that monitors specified files for changes by calculating and comparing their hash values using the SHA-256 algorithm. This tool helps ensure the integrity of files by detecting unauthorized modifications or corruption.

Source:
This code was developed as part of a personal project to enhance my understanding of file integrity monitoring and cryptographic hash functions. The implementation utilizes Python's built-in hashlib library for hash calculations and basic file operations.

What I Learned:

How to calculate file hashes using SHA-256 to ensure data integrity.
The importance of file integrity monitoring in security practices.
Basic file handling in Python, including reading and writing files.
How to implement a simple command-line interface for user interaction.
The significance of using cryptographic techniques to detect changes in files.
